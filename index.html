                <p>
                    For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the <em>most delicious pies</em> at her home. In 2013, we opened our first
                    store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell in love
                    with the <samp>soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies</samp>... The <strong>store</strong> became a success in no time.
                    In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger building.
                    After receiving many <code>requests</code>, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from the
                    comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this: our very own
                    <var>webstore</var>, making it possible to order <kbd>Bethany's delicious pies</kbd> whenever you feel like it!
